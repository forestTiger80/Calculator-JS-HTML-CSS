Here, you'll find a very simple calculator created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You can use it to get an idea of how to build your first web application. Do you know what a web application means? Please read the description below.

DEFINITION:

A web application (web app) is an application program stored on an external server and delivered over the Internet through a web browser interface. By definition, web services are web apps, and many, but not all, websites include web apps. Web applications can be designed for a wide range of purposes and can be used by anyone, from an organization to an individual, for various reasons. Common web applications may include webmail, online calculators, or e-commerce stores. Some web apps may only be accessible via a specific web browser, but most are available on any browser.

How web applications work:

Web applications don't need to be downloaded since they are accessible via a network. Users can access a web application through a web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari. For a web app to function, it requires a web server, an application server, and a database. Web servers handle requests coming from a client, while the application server executes the requested tasks. A database can be used to store all the necessary information. Web applications typically have short development cycles and can be created with small development teams. Most web apps are written in JavaScript, HTML5, or Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Client-side programming usually employs these languages to build an application's frontend. Server-side programming is done to create the scripts that a web app will use. Languages like Python, Java, and Ruby are often used in server-side programming.
